ðŸ“„ User Acquisition Strategy
Project Name: Automatic Timetable Generator â€“ For Faculty

ðŸ‘¥ Who is this app for?
This app is mainly designed for college faculty members and administrators who are responsible for creating timetables. Instead of doing it manually (which takes hours and often leads to conflicts), they can use our tool to save time and reduce errors.

ðŸ“£ How will we reach them?
We plan to:

Share the app on social media like Instagram and LinkedIn

Tell our college faculty and friends in other colleges about it

Show a live demo in our department (if allowed)

List the project on GitHub so others from the open-source community can try it and contribute

ðŸ’¡ Why will they use it?
Because it:

Saves a lot of time and effort

Avoids clashing periods or double bookings

Has a simple and clean design anyone can use

Uses AI to make things smarter

ðŸš€ How can it grow?
In future, weâ€™ll add student logins to see their timetable

We might also let colleges upload their data directly

If colleges like it, we can improve it based on their feedback
